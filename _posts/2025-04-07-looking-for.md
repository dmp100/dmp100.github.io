I read a book that discusses IT service planning. It advised me to write down everything I want - not just to improve my writing skills, but also my comprehension.

So, I've decided to start writing down my thoughts every day, though I'm not sure if I can keep up with a daily schedule.

Here's a reference I'm looking at: [levels.io](https://levels.io/blog/)

The author's name is Pieter Levels. He made up his mind to launch IT services.

12 month, 12 projects - which He did.  but only 5% of projects works.

Anyways, While I naturally prefer to explore things in depth, I've recently realized that to succeed with these projects, I need to focus on creating them efficiently and rapidly.
