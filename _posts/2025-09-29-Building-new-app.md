Have you ever used Reminder

and Atracker ?

## The Problem

I'm currently using two apps: one is a checklist app that manages my schedule and recurring tasks, and the other is ATracker, which tracks my daily routine but requires manual input.

Every time I open ATracker, I have to manually change "gym" to "study," "study" to "gaming," etc. It's tedious. Once I fall behind, there's no catching up.

But Reminder isn't much better—when tasks pile up, it feels hopeless. Both apps feel like just that: tools, nothing more.

So I started thinking about something new.

## The Core Philosophy

I believe a person is defined by their words and actions. What if we could objectively visualize this?

Here's a simple example: I schedule "coding study" for 1-2 PM for lunch break, but it gets postponed for three weeks straight. In reality, during that time, I'm gaming or watching YouTube.

The thing is, I vaguely know this happens, but I don't record it. I rely on memory alone. And memory is unreliable—cognitive distortion leads to misinterpretation.

This app aims to break through that.

## The Solution

Users input their daily schedule, then mark whether they actually completed each task: O, X, or △. An algorithm or AI collects this data over a period of time.

Later, it proactively suggests predictions for empty time slots based on patterns. In other words, it compares your planned schedule with your actual behavior, clearly showing you how you're really living.

Additional features I'm considering: breaking down tasks into smaller chunks, Pomodoro timer integration, and more.

## Tech Stack

Ideally, I'd prefer Android-only development, but since I'm an iPhone user, I'll use Kotlin Multiplatform.

I'm planning this with a full release in mind, and I'm thinking about implementing a subscription model for AI features.

For now, I'll prototype in Figma and iterate from there.

Watch *The Social Network*—that film absolutely nails the building process.

I'll update when there's progress.

Oh, and I'm also planning something with Frieren.
