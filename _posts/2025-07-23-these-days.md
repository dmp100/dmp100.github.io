Sup guys.

Long time no see, fellas.

I went on a trip to Fukuoka, Japan right after my university semester ended.

Walked around streets like this,

Checked out the vibes.

Bought some souvenirs after I got back to Korea.

Even got a Frieren figure.

But what I really want to talk about is this:  
I’d been feeling kinda lethargic lately.  
I thought a trip might fix things — make me feel better.  
But it didn’t work.

So I went to a mental health clinic.  
The doctor told me I have depressive disorder.

To be honest, I’d been feeling down even before the trip.  
I thought getting away might help, but when it didn’t, I realized I needed to get help.  
Getting that diagnosis hit me hard, and honestly, I’m still dealing with it.

What I’ve learned is this:  
Taking care of your physical health is important —  
but taking care of your mental health is just as crucial.  
Lately, I’ve been thinking maybe I wasn’t taking care of myself as well as I thought.  
Humans aren’t machines that run on logic alone.

Funny thing is, adjusting serotonin levels with meds can actually make you feel different.  
It really makes you think.  
Just changing a chemical balance can shift your entire mood and mindset.

It’s not that fucking easy, though.

Anyway, that’s my story for now.  
From here on out, I’m going back to basics — beginner’s mind.

I’ll be sharing my thoughts, progress, and life updates.

See ya.
