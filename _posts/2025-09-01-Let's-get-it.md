These days, I've been studying linear algebra.

It's fucking boring to me, so I haven't touched it for a few days.

After that, I finally realized I'm not the type who follows step-by-step processes. 
My essence is diving into projects and building things even when I have no clue what I'm doing. 
JUST DO IT - that's what I do best.

So here's the thing - my plan is to build J.A.R.V.I.S. with an anime character. 
It would probably be good for building an AI with a waifu's personality, but I chose Frieren instead.
Why? Because I imagine that when I'm in trouble and shout "HELP!", she appears and says "Zoltraak" - then case closed.
Fucking cool, right? Feels like being a protagonist in a movie.

So based on that, I'm also going to add some AR or holograms like Cortana from Halo.
Although I've never played Halo, I can imagine it - Frieren appearing at your desk and talking to you like an old friend.

This is my fucking dream. That's what I'm planning.
