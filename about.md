# Why I Created This Blog

Although I already have a [Blog](https://velog.io/@dmp100/posts) account called Velog, it primarily serves as a personal memory archive. With this new blog, I want to share topics I've explored more deeply and provide valuable insights to you.

# Themes I'm Focusing On

My content will focus on three main areas:

* **Building IT Services From Scratch**: I'll share practical guides on developing applications and services. These will cover everything from initial concept to deployment and maintenance. Expect tutorials, case studies, and lessons learned from my projects.

* **Deep Dives Into Technology Concepts and Trends**: I'll explore complex technical concepts in detail, breaking them down into understandable components. This will include analyses of emerging technologies and how they might reshape the industry.

* **Product and Project Analysis and Evaluation**: I'll review notable tools, platforms, and projects, offering objective assessments of their strengths and limitations based on real-world implementation experience.
