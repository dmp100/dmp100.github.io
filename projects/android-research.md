## Research Focus

Exploring the depths of Android development, from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) to modern UI frameworks like Jetpack Compose.

## Key Research Areas

### AOSP (Android Open Source Project)
- Understanding the Android architecture
- Custom ROM development possibilities
- System-level optimizations

### Jetpack Compose vs SwiftUI
- Comparative analysis of declarative UI frameworks
- Performance benchmarks
- Developer experience differences

### Modern Android Patterns
- Clean Architecture implementation
- MVVM with ViewModels
- Dependency injection with Hilt

## Research Methodology

1. **Literature Review**: Studying official documentation and research papers
2. **Hands-on Experiments**: Building sample applications
3. **Performance Testing**: Benchmarking different approaches
4. **Community Engagement**: Participating in Android developer forums
